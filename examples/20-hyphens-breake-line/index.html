        <p>Bright Star</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art—</p>
        <p>Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night</p>
        <p>And watching, with eternal lids apart,</p>
        <p>Like nature’s patient, sleepless Eremite,</p>
        <p>The moving waters at their priestlike task</p>
        <p>Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores,</p>
        <p>Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask</p>
        <p>Of snow upon the mountains and the moors—</p>
        <p>No–yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,</p>
        <p>Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast,</p>
        <p>To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,</p>
        <p>Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,</p>
        <p>Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,</p>
        <p>And so live ever–or else swoon to death.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The only Way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.</p>
